        <p>Hello this website is made by visual studio code if you have not heard of it so basicaly it is like brackets
            but more better and it has more coding languages than brackets and finds what we are righting more quickly
            then brackets and codepen.io this is the link to set it up https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and you
            will need a folder for it so goodluck finding the next after some other classes * this was for people those
            were under ADV-C77 * Now all the code that I did is on Console so right click click inspect and then Click
            on Console then you will see My name two times because I wrote them with diffrent codes and some numbers and also that this is my first Console project you
            will see that.And if you are under ADV-C77 and you are learning html css and Java script then heres a tip
            for java script you can use the script tag in html to type Javascript in HTML without creating a new folder
            tip over. </p>
